# Weekly review

- Go through all commits for the past 7 days (on the main repo branch).
- Create a very short synthesis of everything that the team shipped based on the commits
- Print 2~5 bullet points explaining the changes
- Also, highlight what you believe was tech debt, what seemed like bug fixes, and what looked like net new functionality in a short paragraph at the end
