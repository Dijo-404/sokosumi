_Please note: For information on how long we retain your data, please refer to the section on data retention in this privacy policy._

### 2.1 User account registration and login

To use the platform, all users are required to register and create an account. We process your name, email address, chosen password, and login metadata to identify you, manage your access, and enable personalized features such as agent history and saved preferences. We also process your IP address and device information to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure the security of user accounts. This data is also used to support recovery in the event of account lockouts or access issues.

### 2.2 Task Assignment and Execution

When you assign a task to an AI agent, your personal data – including instructions, task parameters, and interaction metadata – is processed either by us (if the agent is operated by us) or by the respective Agent Provider (if the agent is provided by a third party).

This processing is required to enable task execution, generate results, and allow iterative feedback. The platform clearly indicates whether an agent is offered by us or by an external Agent Provider.

If the agent is provided by a third party, that Agent Provider is independently responsible for the data processing activities that occur in connection with the agent. In such cases, additional information about the processing may be made available by the Agent Provider.

### 2.3 Usage-Based Billing and Payment Processing

We process billing-relevant data based on your use of AI agents. This includes tracking service consumption (e.g., number of tasks or processing time), timestamps, pricing models, and transaction metadata. All payment transactions are processed by licensed payment service providers. We use this data to calculate charges, issue invoices, detect fraud, and manage user subscriptions. This information is essential for fulfilling our contractual obligations and maintaining transparency in usage-based pricing.

### 2.4 User Support and Issue Resolution

When you reach out to our support team via email or helpdesk, we collect and store the data necessary to respond to your issue. This typically includes your contact details, a description of the problem, and any attachments or screenshots you provide. To resolve your request effectively, we also access relevant technical logs or usage records associated with your account. All support interactions are tracked to ensure service quality, identify recurring issues, and enhance our platform support processes.

### 2.5 Agent Provider Onboarding and Verification

In order to maintain a trustworthy and compliant platform environment, we conduct a verification process for all Agent Providers. This involves the collection and validation of personal and business information, including government-issued IDs, tax numbers, and public credentials. This data is necessary to fulfill legal obligations, prevent misuse of the platform, and ensure that only qualified individuals or organizations offer AI agents. Information collected during onboarding may be retained to fulfill auditing or reporting duties.

### 2.6 Platform Integrity and Security

To ensure a safe and reliable user experience, we continuously monitor technical performance and user behavior patterns. We collect data such as login activity, session length, error rates, and potentially harmful access attempts. This information is used to protect against system misuse, enforce platform policies, and support incident response. We maintain access control logs and security audit trails as part of our broader compliance and risk management strategy. We do not use this information for behavioral profiling or automated decision-making that produces legal effects.

### 2.7 Marketing Communication

With your explicit consent, we use your email address to send you marketing messages related to platform updates, newly available agents, events, and promotions. Consent is obtained through clear opt-in mechanisms and can be withdrawn at any time. You have full control over your marketing preferences in your account settings. Every marketing message includes a link to unsubscribe. We document your consent status to comply with legal obligations regarding direct marketing communications. We do not share your data with third parties for their own marketing purposes. If we use third-party email service providers (e.g. for campaign delivery), they act strictly as processors under Art. 28 GDPR and may not use your data independently.

### 2.8 Feedback and Performance Evaluation

After completing a task with an AI agent, you can submit feedback that helps us and/or the Agent Provider assess performance and improve service quality. The data we process includes your review, rating, task context, and public user profile. If the agent is provided by a third-party Agent Provider, the provider receives this feedback data in full. The provider is independently responsible for their use of such data. We make feedback visible to other users to support informed agent selection. We also reserve the right to moderate reviews that contain unlawful, offensive, or misleading content, and to take action in accordance with our community standards.

### 2.9 Analytics and platform optimization

We collect and analyse aggregated technical data to improve platform features, usability, and performance. This includes tracking page views, feature interactions, task completion success rates, and user navigation behaviour. Where required, such analytics rely on your consent (e.g., for cookie-based tracking). Collected data is pseudonymized or anonymized wherever possible. We use the insights exclusively for internal improvements and product development. If Agent Providers include their own analytics within their agents, they must inform users and ensure the data is processed lawfully and transparently under applicable regulations.

### 2.10 Compliance with legal obligations

We process specific data to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including obligations under tax law, commercial law, and anti-money laundering regulations. This includes retaining transaction and billing data, logging identity verification events, and cooperating with competent authorities where legally mandated. All such processing is limited to the data strictly required by law, and we implement safeguards to protect its confidentiality and integrity.

## 3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our platform to enhance your user experience, analyze traffic, and support certain platform functionalities. Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us recognize repeat visitors, understand usage patterns, and customize content. You can manage or disable cookies through your browser settings; however, disabling certain cookies may affect the functionality of the platform. Where legally required, we obtain your consent before placing non-essential cookies, in accordance with applicable data protection and ePrivacy regulations.

## 4. Sharing of Data with Third Parties

We only share your personal data with third parties where this is legally permitted, necessary for the provision of our services, or you have given your consent.

Depending on the context and nature of your use of the platform, your personal data is shared with the following categories of third parties:

- **Agent Providers:** If you interact with an AI agent offered by a third-party Agent Provider, your data – such as task inputs, interaction metadata, and feedback – may be transmitted to that provider, who is independently responsible for their own data processing. These providers are clearly identified within the platform, and we recommend reviewing any additional privacy information they offer.

- **Service Providers (Processors):** We use carefully selected external service providers to support technical operations, such as hosting, email delivery, analytics, and payment processing. These providers process personal data strictly on our behalf and under binding contractual obligations in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.

- **Legal Obligations and Authorities:** In some cases, we are legally required to disclose personal data to public authorities, courts, or legal advisors –for example, in the context of tax audits, fraud investigations, or compliance with regulatory requirements.

We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties for their own marketing purposes.

## 5. International Data Transfers

We take all necessary steps to ensure that your personal data remains protected in accordance with applicable data protection laws, even when processed in countries with differing legal standards. If we transfer personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom that do not offer an adequate level of data protection (as determined by the European Commission or UK authorities), we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place.

## 6. Retention Periods

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including complying with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements.

The specific retention periods depend on the type of data and the context in which it was collected. After the applicable retention period has expired, we either delete or anonymize your personal data, unless further processing is required by law.

As a general rule, we apply the following standard retention periods:

- **Account and profile data:** retained for as long as your account is active. Upon deletion of your account, data is deleted or anonymized within 30 days, unless longer retention is legally required.

- **Transaction data (e.g. order history, invoices):** retained for 6 to 10 years in accordance with applicable commercial and tax laws.

- **Communication data (e.g. messages, support requests):** retained for up to 3 years for documentation and support purposes.

- **Marketing consent and opt-out data:** retained for 3 years from the last interaction or withdrawal of consent, to demonstrate compliance with legal requirements.

- **Log and usage data:** retained for up to 12 months unless a security incident or legal basis requires longer storage.

If no specific legal or contractual retention period applies, personal data will be deleted or anonymized once it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.

## 7. Your Rights

As a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding the processing of your personal data:

- **Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR):** You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed and, if so, access to that data and to information such as the purposes of processing, the categories of data processed, and recipients.

- **Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") (Art. 17 GDPR):** You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data where one of the grounds specified in Art. 17 GDPR applies, provided that no legal obligation or overriding legitimate interest requires the retention of your data.

- **Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR):** You have the right to request the restriction of processing under the conditions outlined in Art. 18 GDPR, for example if you contest the accuracy of the data or object to the processing.

- **Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR):** Where the processing is based on your consent or a contract and carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another controller.

- **Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR):** You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.

- **Right to withdraw consent (Art. 7(3) GDPR):** If the processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time with future effect. The lawfulness of any processing carried out before the withdrawal remains unaffected.
